# DESIGN-OF-STATE-FEEDBACK-CONTROL-SYSTEM
- This project aims at developing a control system for the given transfer function of a plant considering the sensor dynamics. Thus, the project involves designing the control system parameters for required time domain characteristics of the closed loop system, writing a MATLAB script and building a mathematical model for simulation of the system. There are two control systems designed for the given plant and then the performance of both the controllers is compared.
- In this project, first of all we have analyzed the systemâ€™s stability and open loop system response.
- Then, we have designed the PID control system for required time domain characteristics of the closed loop system response.
- As per the first stage design results, the PID controller is then tuned for meeting required specifications.
- Parallelly, we have designed state feedback controller and then it is tuned for meeting the required specifications.
